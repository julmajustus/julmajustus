## btrtile — A Focus-Driven Tiling Layout for dwl.

btrtile is a dynamic tiling layout patch designed for the [dwl](https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl) window manager. It provides a focus-driven, mouse- and keyboard-friendly tiling layout that grants you granular control over how clients are placed and resized.

## Mini Benchmark Scraper — Linux system benchmark vizualizer.

Mini Benchmark Scraper is a Python script that automates the extraction, parsing, and visualization of benchmark data from [Mini Benchmarker](https://gitlab.com/torvic9/mini-benchmarker) log files. It processes multiple log files, computes averages across different benchmark modes for each kernel version, and generates comparison bar charts embedded in an HTML page for easy analysis.

Used also in [Cachyos-benchmarker](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-benchmarker)

## philosophers - Dining philosophers problem.

The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classical problem used to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for preventing deadlock and starvation. In this project, you will find two solutions:

   - Pthreads Implementation: Uses threads and mutexes.
   - Bonus (Semaphores & Processes): Uses processes and semaphores.

This project is written in C and provides a hands-on example of concurrent programming.

## push_swap - Optimized Sorting with a Greedy Approach.

Sorting is a fundamental skill every developer should master. This project challenges you to implement an efficient sorting algorithm in C while getting hands-on with algorithmic complexity. Instead of traditional linked lists, this solution uses circular arrays to represent stacks, offering an alternative perspective on data structure design.

## pipex - Command Piping in C

pipex is a C project that replicates shell command piping. It demonstrates how to create child processes, manage file descriptors, and set up pipelines to emulate shell behavior.

[More detailed description in project repo](https://github.com/julmajustus/pipex)
