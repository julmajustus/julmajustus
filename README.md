### philosophers - Dining philosophers problem.

The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classical problem used to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for preventing deadlock and starvation. In this project, you will find two solutions:

   - Pthreads Implementation: Uses threads and mutexes.
   - Bonus (Semaphores & Processes): Uses processes and semaphores.

This project is written in C and provides a hands-on example of concurrent programming.

### push_swap - Optimized Sorting with a Greedy Approach.

Sorting is a fundamental skill every developer should master. This project challenges you to implement an efficient sorting algorithm in C while getting hands-on with algorithmic complexity. Instead of traditional linked lists, this solution uses circular arrays to represent stacks, offering an alternative perspective on data structure design.
